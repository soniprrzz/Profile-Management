# Profile-Management

This project, named Geek Text, is a Java-based web application developed using Spring Boot, Visual Studio Code, and MySQL. It includes a comprehensive profile management system for users within a specialized technology-focused online bookstore. Users can create, retrieve, and update their profiles, providing essential details such as username, password, name, email address, and home address. Additionally, the application supports the creation of credit cards linked to user accounts. The backend is structured with Spring Boot, utilizing JPA for database interactions. The directory structure is organized to separate concerns into models, repositories, services, controllers, and exceptions. This project serves as a foundation for a scalable and modular web application tailored for a niche technology bookstore.
